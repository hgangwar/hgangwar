# Projects #
### [MATLAB-Simulink Challenge Project](https://github.com/hgangwar/EV_MPC_main) ###
Electric Vehicle Energy Optimization with NMPC.

### [Digital Twin and Virtual Reality](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16if7GLftrRDi2676rtVdVzksr1iznG_5/view?usp=sharing) ###
A Digital Twin of the BELIV lab's autonomous vehicle and virtual reality in the sense that the software stack on real vehicle can respond to the virtual objects in the simulator.

### [Driver Monitoring System](https://github.com/hgangwar/Driver-Monitoring-System) ###
Designed and deployed a machine learning-based driver monitoring system. Engineered a streamlined video streaming pipeline for real-time monitoring. Leveraged state-of-the-art CNN architectures for robust classification. Enhances safety across diverse applications.

### [Research Projects: Ensuring Feasibility and Stability of NMPC with Non-Overshooting Constraints](https://github.com/hgangwar/Non-overshooting-MPC) ###
Under ASU's MORE Program for Summer 2023. Researched safety conditions for finite horizon MPC and nonlinear systems. Evaluated various NMPC approaches, including stochastic and tube-based methods. Calculated positive invariant sets for complex nonlinear dynamics, enhancing system behavior understanding.
